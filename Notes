Encapsulation:
    Create classes to write code and store data. Use private access modifiers to secure
    the data by limiting the access. Create getter/setter methods for every field if
    you want others to change or see those fields.
Why should we learn about Encapsulation?
    It improves the control over the data that we store in the fields of a class which
    leads us to more secure code.
==========================================================================================
Collections framework:
  Collections framework in java contains a lot of classes and interfaces.
  Which help us store and manipulate large amounts of data easily and efficiantly.
Why?
  Arrays have limitations
  1. they  are fixed in size meaning once we provide the size we can't change
